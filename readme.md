## Description of the proposed solution
For the description of the proposed solution, I need to talk about what my solution will do, what the key features of the application will be and how I will develop the solution (e.g., what programming language I will use, APIs). Most importantly, I need to talk about how my solution will align with relevant data protection and accessibility laws.

## Rationale
For the rationale section, I need to talk about how my proposed solution aligns with client and user needs. I need to also talk about how I intend to mitigate potential risks with security, constraints etc.


## Test Plan/Design

## Create visual/interface designs.
I need to create visual/interface designs of the application that I will produce. I need to explain the reasons for my designs and how the screens will respond to user inputs, data inputs etc.

## Entity Relationship Diagrams.
I need to create an entity relationship diagram to show how the database(s) in the application will work and how they will interact with the app.

## Data Dictionary
I need to create a data dictionary to break down the specific pieces of data that will be stored within the database. I need to specify the data type, field size, the key type and give examples of data that can be stored for each field in the dictionary.

## Algorithms and Flowcharts
I need to create visual designs of my program that appeal to both a technical and non-technical audience. I need to give descriptions underneath each design and add comments under pieces of pseudocode.

## Test Strategy/Plan
I need to create a test strategy which outlines how I am going to test the solution after it is developed. I need to showcase the order in which components are going to be tested and use different types of test data.
